The research investigates whether LLMs (ChatGPT and DeepSeek) align more closely with books or their movie adaptations, using Twilight and New Moon as case studies. By applying textual similarity, knowledge, and close reading probing, the study finds that LLMs favor books over movies unless explicitly prompted. ChatGPT proved more accurate than DeepSeek, which misidentified key scenes and struggled with contextual follow-ups. The study acknowledges limitations such as training bias, challenges in analyzing visual storytelling, and copyright concerns.

In a separate experiment on genre classification using lyrics, few-shot prompting outperformed zero-shot prompting. While it improved accuracy, the model still struggled with less common genres, non-English lyrics, and overlapping genre characteristics. To enhance performance, more structured prompts and diverse multilingual datasets are recommended.
